Hello! In this assignment, we will be working on several exercises from the ISLP book:

Let's begin by importing our modules:

``` {python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels as sm
import matplotlib as plt
import random 
```

## Exercise 1 - 3.3
Suppose we have a data set with five predictors:
Suppose we have a data set with five predictors:

- **X1** = GPA
- **X2** = IQ
- **X3** = Level (1 for College and 0 for High School)
- **X4** = Interaction between GPA and IQ
- **X5** = Interaction between GPA and Level
The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). 

Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get:

- βˆ0 = 50,
- βˆ1 = 20,
- βˆ2 = 0.07,
- βˆ3 = 35,
- βˆ4 = 0.01,
- βˆ5 = −10.

### (a) Which answer is correct, and why?

#### i. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn more, on average, than college graduates.

#### ii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn more, on average, than high school graduates.

#### iii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn more, on average, than college graduates provided that the GPA is high enough.

#### iv. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn more, on average, than high school graduates provided that the GPA is high enough.

### (b) Predict the salary of a college graduate with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0.

### (c) True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect. Justify your answer.


## Exercise 2 - 3.4
I collect a set of data (n = 100 observations) containing a single predictor and a quantitative response. I then fit a linear regression model to the data, as well as a separate cubic regression, i.e. $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \beta_3 X^3 + \varepsilon.$$

### (a) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is linear, i.e. Y = β0 + β1X + ε. Consider the training residual sum of squares (RSS) for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.

### (b) Answer (a) using test rather than training RSS.

### (c) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is not linear, but we don’t know how far it is from linear. Consider the training RSS for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.

### (d) Answer (c) using test rather than training RSS.


## Exercise 3 - 3.10 (a-g)
**This question should be answered using the Carseats data set.**

Let's begin by importing the dataset:
``` {python}

```

### (a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict Sales using Price, Urban, and US.

### (b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful—some of the variables in the model are qualitative!

### (c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.

### (d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H0 :βj =0?

### (e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.

### (f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?

### (g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).

## Exercise 4 - 3.13

**13. In this exercise you will create some simulated data and will fit simple linear regression models to it. Make sure to use the default random number generator with seed set to 1 prior to starting part (a) to ensure consistent results.**

### (a) Using the normal() method of your random number generator, create a vector, x, containing 100 observations drawn from a N(0,1) distribution. This represents a feature, X.

### (b) Using the normal() method, create a vector, eps, containing 100 observations drawn from a N(0,0.25) distribution—a normal distribution with mean zero and variance 0.25.

### (c) Using x and eps, generate a vector y according to the model Y =−1+0.5X+ε. What is the length of the vector y? What are the values of β0 and β1 in this linear model?

### (d) Create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between x and y. Comment on what you observe.

### (e) Fit a least squares linear model to predict y using x. Comment on the model obtained. How do βˆ0 and βˆ1 compare to β0 and β1?

### (f) Display the least squares line on the scatterplot obtained in (d). Draw the population regression line on the plot, in a different color. Use the legend() method of the axes to create an appropriate legend.

### (g) Now fit a polynomial regression model that predicts y using x and x2. Is there evidence that the quadratic term improves the model fit? Explain your answer.

### (h) Repeat (a)–(f) after modifying the data generation process in such a way that there is less noise in the data. The model (3.39) should remain the same. You can do this by decreasing the vari- ance of the normal distribution used to generate the error term ε in (b). Describe your results.

### (i) Repeat (a)–(f) after modifying the data generation process in such a way that there is more noise in the data. The model (3.39) should remain the same. You can do this by increasing the variance of the normal distribution used to generate the error term ε in (b). Describe your results.

### (j) What are the confidence intervals for β0 and β1 based on the original data set, the noisier data set, and the less noisy data set? Comment on your results.


## Exercise 5 - 3.15

This problem involves the Boston data set, which we saw in the lab for this chapter. We will now try to predict per capita crime rate using the other variables in this data set. In other words, per capita crime rate is the response, and the other variables are the predictors.

Import dataset:
``` {python}

```

### (a) For each predictor, fit a simple linear regression model to predict the response. Describe your results. In which of the models is there a statistically significant association between the predictor and the response? Create some plots to back up your assertions.

### (b) Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors. Describe your results. For which predictors can we reject the null hypothesis H0 : βj = 0?

### (c) How do your results from (a) compare to your results from (b)? Create a plot displaying the univariate regression coefficients from (a) on the x-axis, and the multiple regression coefficients from (b) on the y-axis. That is, each predictor is displayed as a single point in the plot. Its coefficient in a simple linear regres- sion model is shown on the x-axis, and its coefficient estimate in the multiple linear regression model is shown on the y-axis.

### (d) Is there evidence of non-linear association between any of the predictors and the response? To answer this question, for each predictor X, fit a model of the form Y =β0 +β1X+β2X2 +β3X3 +ε.
